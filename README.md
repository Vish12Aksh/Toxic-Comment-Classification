# Toxic-Comment-Classification
  
Dataset: Includes text comments labeled with toxicity categories like "toxic" or "identity_hate."

Preprocessing: Text is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized.

EDA: Analyze toxicity distribution to understand data better.

Feature Engineering: Create useful features to improve model performance.

Modeling: Train machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, PassiveAggressiveClassifier) or advanced models (BERT, LSTM).

Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall to assess model.

Libraries: Utilize Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better results.

Deployment: Make predictions on unseen data or integrate into applications.
